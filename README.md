# License Plate Reader

In this project I use two object detection models created using the train_model.ipynb script to make a license plate reader. The script trains two YOLOv5 models; one to identify and segment the location of a license plate and the next to read the characters of the license plate and return the plate numbers.

An output from the model can be seen below:
